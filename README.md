# Known Issues
Play time is not set to 0h 0m in the provided save file. This should be fixed in a future update.
Most vivosaurs do not show up properly in the Fossilary. I don't know how to fix this.
Vivosaurs which super evolve are duplicated in the holder. I don't know how to fix this. Donating the duplicates has some broken behavior. Please don't do that.
Currently there are no options that turn off certain types of checks (such as Revivals and Super Revivals). I plan to fix this in a future update.
